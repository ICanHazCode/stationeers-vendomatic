Using VendingMachine.OnCustomImportFinished, first scan for slots of Stackable with same PrefabHash and combine (using OnServer.Combine ?)

Export is done with DeviceImportExport.OnCustomExportFinished.  Need to work before this though to set ExportSlot.Occupant to a new stack of the desired size

Setting ExportSlot is done on VendingMachine.InteractWith, inside the InteractableType.Activate case
OnServer.MoveToSlot(this.CurrentSlot.Occupant, this.ExportSlot)
We need to split some off (see Stackable.SplitStack for details on how to do this safely; we need to call OnSplitStack to the new stack).
We can probably use OnServer.Create(prefabName, slot) to create it directly in the output slot
